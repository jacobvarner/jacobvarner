Meteor allows for live-reloading pages which made it possible to dynamically change stats for different time windows such as the last 3, 5, or 10 games. Currently, stats must be entered manually through a back-end submission form that I access, but eventually, I’d like to have the site read in the official stats that are posted after each game.</p>

I like to build side projects that I can continue to use and this is one that I have used the most since creating it. The <a href="https://jekyllrb.com/" target="_blank">Jekyll</a> framework allows for sorting posts by category and assigning tags to the posts. For this design, I had to figure out the best way to incorporate ads into the site and try to maximize the number of posts a user would read when they visited the site each time.</p>

The site also features collections of my results and routes around the Auburn area.

I used a similar design as the Auburn Flyers website on this one and still aimed to add some <a href="https://jquery.com/" target="_blank">jQuery</a> to a few aspects of the site so that I could get more comfortable using the framework.</p>

I really enjoyed working with <a href="http://rubyonrails.org/" target="_blank">Ruby on Rails</a> and hope to be able to use it in another project soon.
