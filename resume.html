      <h2>Major Projects</h2>
      <div class="projects-div">
        <h3>Auburn Disc Golf | Android</h3>
        <p>Auburn Disc Golf is a simple guide to the disc golf course on Auburn Univesity’s campus that also provides a scorekeeping system for users. I stored images for the course locally within the app and used a simple SQLlite database to keep track of scores. This was my first major Android applicaiton and was published in the fall of 2013.</p>
      </div>
      <div class="projects-div">
        <h3>War Eagle BEST and South's BEST Websites | HTML, Bootstrap</h3>
        <p>In the summer of 2015 I redesigned and redeveloped the websites for our War Eagle BEST and South’s BEST Robotics Competitions. In order to keep things simple, I opted to use basic HTML for the content and styled each site using the Bootstrap framework. These sites are used by teachers and students competing in the competitions so that they can receive news and updated information.</p>
      </div>
      <div class="projects-div">
        <h3>The Jungle Times | PHP, Ruby on Rails, Sass</h3>
        <p>The Jungle Times is an independent Auburn basketball blog that I designed and developed from scratch first using PHP and then later using Ruby on Rails. The site is a simple blog with a client side editor for adding articles and forum posts. I used Sass to style the site as I find it easier to work with than normal CSS. The Jungle Times was published first in June 2015 and then redone in September.</p>
      </div>
      <div class="projects-div">
        <h3>Auburn Disc Golf | Meteor.js, Blaze, Sass</h3>
        <p>Auburn Basketball is a visually pleasing, one stop site for all Auburn Basketball records and stats. I used Meteor.js mostly to make use of its live reloading that makes changing stat categories quick and seamless. I can add stats on the client side and they are then stored in a MongoDB collection. I used the Blaze templating language built into Meteor and Sass for styling. First published in March 2016.</p>
