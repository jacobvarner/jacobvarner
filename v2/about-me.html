        <p>Hello, world! My name is Jacob Varner and I am a Software Engineering student at Auburn University with passions for Jesus, learning new skills, development, college basketball, and cycling. My responsibilities include working for the <a href="http://www.auburn.edu/cosam/outreach">College of Sciences and Mathematics Outreach Office at Auburn</a> as well as serving as the leader of <a href="http://www.auburntigers.com/jungle/">The Jungle, Auburn Basketball's student section</a>. I fuel my busy schedule with Taco Bell and Mountain Dew as well as with the encouragement from a lovely girlfriend and a supportive family of seven.</p>
        <p>I live my busy life trying to learn new things each day and continue to strive to make myself a better, more efficient human. Whether this is learning a new language or framework, reading about a new productivity "hack," or trying to <a href="https://www.strava.com/athletes/8503705">get faster and go further on my bicycle</a> I genuinely enjoy the quest for improvement. For entertainment I prefer to watch YouTube series that focus on teaching new development skills and when I have free time I look to spend it working on <a href="https://www.github.com/jacobvarner">one of my many side projects</a>.</p>
        <p>As I've always been someone striving for self-improvement, I've had some great help along the way. In high school I greatly benefited from being apart of the Math Team with an excellent teacher and was wonderfully prepared for college engineering classes and a future career as an engineer by completing four years of the <a href="http://www.eahoover.com">Engineering Academy at Hoover High School</a>. Not only did I learn a ton of practical skills through the Engineering Academy, it also set me up for a very rewarding summer internship with <a href="http://www.fitz-thors.com">Fitz-Thors Engineering, Inc.</a> the summer after graduating high school and helped me get a position with COSAM Outreach where I am now the head scorekeeper for both the <a href="http://www.wareaglebest.org">War Eagle BEST Robotics Competition</a> and the <a href="http://www.southsbest.org">South's BEST Regional Robotics Championship</a> along with several other science and technology based programs.</p>
        <p>Along with my drive to improve myself the same determination and self-motivation makes me want to eventually run my own business and create something useful for many people with software. With this goal in mind, I plan to pursue a Masters in Business Administration along with a Masters in Industrial Engineering after completing my undergraduate degree. An MBA will allow me to manage and lead any future projects with a much better ability while the Industrial Engineering degree will allow me to further explore the benefits of efficiency that can be applied to my projects and whatever work I do throughout my career.</p>
        <p>As a very busy Software Engineering student, basketball enthusiast, and cyclist it's quite difficult to fully share who I am in just a few paragraphs. I believe one of the best ways to truly understand how my brain works and what I enjoy talking about the most is to <a href="https://www.twitter.com/jacobvarner14">follow me on Twitter</a> where I Tweet all about those three areas of my life as well as whatever else interests me at the moment.</p>
